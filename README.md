# 🎮 Agha Talha
**`Unity Wizard (Programmer/Animator/Automation-Expert)`**

I'm a Unity Game Developer and a Gaming enthusiast building my version of virtual world one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. My aim is to bring games to life, wether by giving life to an environment through code or by animating a dead model. Through constant learning I can handle anything you throw at me.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Journey</h3></summary>
   Twenty years ago I saw the first light of day. In my early days I spent most of my time playing video games with my brothers. Over the years I developed a questionably healthy interest and curiosity towards games and how they were made. I spent quite a lot of time in level editors and development journeys than playing the actual games. That curiosity turned me into what I am today, a creative professional yet still eager to learn more tricks of the trade. In 2025 I will receive my bachelor's degree in Computer Sciences with major in Game Development at the FAST University of Computer Sciences. I keep improving myself as the industry moves forward. During my studies, I have worked for a years as Jr.Game Programmer at a Islamabad game studio We.R.Play. In 2022 I joined Smarnovative Labs as Game Programmer & System Automator. During my journey along the way, I've gathered new insights and different perspectives. New engines, new tools, met new people, improved my scripting abilities. In my spare time I sometimes work on personal projects, varying from commercial projects to small hobby projects - either way I'm always learning.
