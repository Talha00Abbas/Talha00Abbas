**`Unity Wizard (Programmer/Animator/Automation-Expert)`**

I'm a Unity Game Developer and a Gaming enthusiast building my version of virtual world one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. My aim is to bring games to life, wether by giving life to an environment through code or by animating a dead model. Through constant learning I can handle anything you throw at me.
